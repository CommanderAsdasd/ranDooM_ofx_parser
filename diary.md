# Running project

Lein new not adding :main function, so need to add 
'''
:main randoomofx.core/foo 
'''
to "(defproject)" in project.clj
but for 'lein repl' /foo is not needed, it will be causing an error:
'''
:main randoomofx.core 
'''
# Notes
There is cool .lein-repl-history file generated by Leiningen
